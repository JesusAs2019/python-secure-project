Novel Synthesis of Aspirin Derivatives Using Catalytic Hydrogenation

Abstract
We report a novel catalytic method for synthesizing aspirin derivatives with 
significantly improved efficiency. Using palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst 
in ethanol solvent at 85°C, we achieved 94% yield compared to traditional 
methods yielding only 78%.

Introduction
Aspirin and its derivatives are among the most widely used pharmaceutical 
compounds globally. Traditional synthesis methods suffer from low yields, 
long reaction times, and environmental concerns due to excessive solvent use.

Methods
We employed a catalytic hydrogenation approach using 5% Pd/C in ethanol at 
85°C under 2 bar hydrogen pressure. Reaction progress was monitored by HPLC.

Results
- Yield: 94% (vs. 78% traditional)
- Reaction time: 2.5 hours (vs. 4.5 hours traditional)
- Cost: £8/kg (vs. £15/kg traditional)
- Solvent waste: 30% reduction

The optimized temperature of 85°C was critical; higher temperatures led to 
decomposition, while lower temperatures slowed the reaction significantly.

Discussion
This method represents a significant improvement in pharmaceutical synthesis. 
The 45% reduction in reaction time combined with improved yield makes this 
approach economically attractive for industrial scale-up.

Conclusion
We have developed a superior catalytic method for aspirin derivative synthesis 
with clear advantages in yield, cost, and environmental impact. Patent 
application UK-2024-12345 has been filed.
